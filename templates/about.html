    <p1>The JosephGPA tool is named after my best friend, because one day I had the idea to buy this domain for a good deal.
        This tool is made from the Flask network, and is currently running off of a Raspberry Pi B+ from my home, and is proxied through Cloudflare.
        If you are looking to make a website, or need some help with coding things, feel free to reach out to admin@josephgpa.site for your needs (Make sure this is allowed by your school's email policy first).

        But now, onto the important stuff. I want to thank Mr. Julian Morral for being such an amazing help and inspiration for me and all of my projects.
        He has been an amazing help, and has provided me with the tools and knowledge required to make this website, get everything up and running, and he has
        helped in so many other ways, so that he can support people like me, who love to be challenged and have fun with technology.
    </p1>

        I give my utmost thanks to you, Mr. Julian, if you are reading this, and of course thank <b>YOU</b> for visiting my website! I appreciate you!
